# jekyll-post-via-web
A simple HTML+JS page that allows you to post new articles to your GitHub-hosted Jekyll blog, using a browser.

## What is this?
If you host your Jekyll blog on GitHub, you can use jekyll-web-post to post new articles from a browser.
You can find more details here: [Post to your GitHub-hosted blog using a simple bookmarklet.](https://blog.vrypan.net/2015/05/29/post-to-github-jekyll-using-a-bookmarklet/)

## Installation
Just copy cms.html to the root of your Jekyll blog source, and deploy. Then visit the page using your web browser, 
usually at `<url>/<base_url>/cms.html`.

## Support this project
I've worked on jekyll-post-via-web by "stealing" time from my main project, [BigStash](https://www.bigstash.co).
So, **if you'd like to support me, just have a look at my company's blog, [blog.bigstash.co](http://blog.bigstash.co)**
&mdash;it would mean a lot to me. Thank you!
